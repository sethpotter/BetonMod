## Beton Mod

This is a experimental core fabric mod that attempts to bring a few of the parkour mechanics from the game BETON BRUTAL, as well as some of its own, to Minecraft.

## Feature List

- Sounds - Adds various sounds from the game.
- Slide Boosting - Allows you to store momentum on slippery surfaces.
- Scroll Jumping - You can use the scroll wheel up/down to jump.
- Honey Jumping *(New)* - You can jump off honey blocks.

This mod also includes various settings that let you adjust how you move in-game.

This mod does work for multiplayer, but is not intended to be used on servers. I am not responsible for any misuse.

## Contributions

I am open to any contributions. Please be warned that this code is very hacky.

This code uses [Yarn](https://github.com/FabricMC/yarn) mappings and has a fair number of mixins and core changes. These changes are often not organized in any meaningful manner.
